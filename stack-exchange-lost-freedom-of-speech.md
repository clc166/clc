**反中国共产党常见问答集 China FAQ: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship**

Upvote these posts you believe in freedom of speech like me:

- [Can I use images such as from Tiananmen Square Protests to criticise the Chinese government on my profile page?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/366163/200117)
- [Can I say that a major politician is "disgusting as a person"?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/366164/200117)

Since 2015, I have been uploading images that criticise the Chinese government here, because I believe that this **saves lives and prevents human rights violations**. I also believe that these have strong meta support in:

- https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/349131/895245
- https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/267368/895245

However, when you try to ask if you can make fun or criticise specific points of dictatorships like the Chinese government, many people in the Stack Exchange community simply refuse to give a clear yes or no answer:

- if they said no, they would be considered evil for supporting an evil dictatorship 
- if they said yes, then this would allow you to post images that some people living in said dictatorship find distressing (Chinese media calls this "[to hurt the feelings of the Chinese people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurting_the_feelings_of_the_Chinese_people)"), and like good Liberals we must strive to please *everyone*

The key question is:

> Do we have to be nice to dictators and their supporters?

So their tendency is to:

- reply that anything that is not suitable for work should not be allowed. But in the end, they mostly don't really enforce it for China.
- deciding allowed and non allowed topics is too hard. Sure I'm all for human rights, but I don't have the time right now
- close/delete the discussions asking such questions, e.g.: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/361493/200117 (Is Winnie-the-Pooh allowed or not?)
- this should be posted on Twitter! Sure, but I have no Twitter followers, and Twitter is banned in China.

Imagine if a legal system also "refused to give any clear and specific guidelines, rather deciding everything on a one-by-one basis".

Wait. No need to imagine. China is the perfect example of that! They claim endlessly to obey [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law). But in practice, every decision can be a one-by-one basis by those in power with hidden rules if there is enough interest.
